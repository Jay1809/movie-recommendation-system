🚀 Excited to share my latest project in the field of data science: *Movie Recommendation System*! 🎬✨

For this project, I:
1. 🗂 *Merged two datasets*: one containing movie details and the other with credit information.
2. 🧹 *Cleaned and preprocessed* the combined dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.
3. 🧠 *Applied a machine learning algorithm* to build a recommendation model.
4. 🔍 *Predicted* movies that users would enjoy based on their preferences and viewing history.

This project honed my skills in Python, pandas, and machine learning, and was a fantastic opportunity to explore data merging, cleaning, and predictive modeling. 

Looking forward to leveraging these skills in my future data science and data engineering endeavors!
